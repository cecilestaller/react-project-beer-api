# Beer-API / React Project 🍻

- This project was created as part of a Full-Stack Webdeveloper bootcamp from supercode.

- The learning objective of the project:
- internalize the handling of useState- and useEffect-hooks in react
- the dynamic creation of detail pages using an API and the react npm package: react-router-dom

## How does the Beer-Website work?

- the website imitates a beer online store with a home page on which the user has two options:

1. the user can click on "all beers" and is redirected to an overview of all beers. If the user then clicks on the "Details" button, he is redirected to a detailed page of the beer, where he receives even more information about the beer
2. the user can click on "Random Beer" and will be forwarded directly to a detail page of a randomly selected beer.

- If the user clicks on the arrow, he is taken to the previous page.
- By clicking on the beer symbol in the nav bar below, the user is always taken to the home page
